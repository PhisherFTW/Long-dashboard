            <div class="acc-content">
                <h3>What we went through and focus areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on putting yourself in a position to trade teammates or have them trade you instead of trying to go solo</li>
                    <li>When holding a corner make sure to position your crosshair a fair distance from the corner and try to imagine what kind of peek the enemy will most likely do against you.</li>
                    <li>Always point your crosshair at the next most likely position for an enemy to peek you from even if you are falling back and think they probably won't peek</li>
                    <li>Try to take advantage of each sides advantages like T side: Weaponry Advantage / Peekers advantage and CT sides: Positional advantage / Holding advantage</li>
                    <li>Different molly lineup for top banana which is more effective and safer</li>
                    <li>When playing against pistols its important to try maintain and keep your distance because the closer you get to them the more dangeorus they become.</li>
                    <li>When playing with the USP try to keep your distance and use its insanely good accuracy to your advantage by tapping</li>
                    <li>When playing with the Famas try playing it like its an upgraded SMG as you will have alot more success like that because the Famas is by far the weakest rifle and trying to take long range fights will be difficult</li>
                    <li>Learn the quickest timings someone can be at a location as sometimes during that game you dropped utility when it was impossible for the enemy to actually be there.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower your sens to 1 ingame and 800dpi</li>
                    <li>Practise with the Routine provided for a minimum of 1 month before making changes</li>
                    <li>Try to play at least 1 comp per day and make sure you properly warmup before every game</li>
                    <li>Focus on improving 1 skill or 1 smart GOAL at a time till you have it at your desired level then move onto the next while maintaining it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Community FFA Deathmatch</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large flicks are imprecise often largely over-flicking enemies positions</li>
                    <li>micro adjustments are incredibly hard because of the higher sensitivtiy and you look uncomfortable fighting at range</li>
                    <li>Overly relying on crouching whenever spraying an enemy makes you an easy target</li>
                    <li>Often starts shooting before the crosshair is locked onto an enemy</li>
                    <li>Raw point click aim is pretty good but would benefit greatly from decreasing sensitivtiy</li>
                    <li>Sometimes does a "style" flick after getting a kill as some awpers do which isn't necessarily bad but it can get you punished especially with a rifle</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Armour, Good crosshair placement moving up second middle, solid kill on the enemy pushing through the arch smoke and fantastic reactions to get the enemy pushing lane behind you and nice flick onto the guy coming out apps, fantastic reposition to completely catch the last guy coming up lane off-guard and overall a fantastic 4k and clutch. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression and molly into apps although you are taking a lot of solo engagements and pushing into positions by yourself, nice peek from boiler onto the enemy lane and good preaim and crosshair placement, solid pathing onto site and unfortunately you got killed from a good off-angle. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flash top middle, interesting molly top banana but it still leaves room for an enemy to peek behind it, solid angle clearing to kill the enemy close wall top banana but unfortunately your teammates were not close enough to trade your death you were a bit too far ahead of them. W</li>
                    <li>no buy, internet dropped, missed the round. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy,  internet dropped again, L</li>
                    <li>Deagle, stream came on late, unfortunate timing led to you being flanked in Mexico which led to you dying. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job holding the push stairs apps but your crosshair was too close to the corner if an enemy did peek the stairs you would have to flick in order to get the kill, the enemy was sitting on the stairs with a Mag7 which managed to instantly kill you unfortunately you were too far from your teammates to allow them to get a trade kill on you. L</li>
                    <li>Scout buy, when getting out Mexico you didn’t look towards the danger top middle which could have easily gotten you killed you should always look at the first point of possible contact so if an enemy does peek you can at least fight back, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window flash banana, Good angle clearing apps although its still very dangerous to do it alone, good rotate to banana without making a lot of noise, nice flash into CT, do not give away your positional advantage(enemy not knowing your position) for free as once they know where you are hiding it makes their job a lot easier. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at backing up your teammate apps but you should have tried to be closer so you could attempt a trade while he was still being shot at unfortunately you were just a bit late which allowed the 2 enemies in apps to refocus their attention onto you which allowed them to kill you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at mollying top banana but the molly you throw can leave a gap behind it which can allow the enemy to still peek banana, nice reaction to kill the enemy pushing down banana and nice preaim and attempted prefire to get the awper on the corner holding you, good attempt at hunting down the awper. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice nade banana, unfortunate timing on the push through the bottom banana smoke which got you killed by the enemy sitting top banana with a awp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice kill top banana but very dangerous peek as you pushed close against pistols and had no one to trade you, good patience waiting for the top banana smoke to fade fortunately when it did an unaware enemy pushed through and you managed to clean him up, fantastic round overall as you managed to keep pushing and peeking into angles the enemies were not aware of and it allowed to you get an ace. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice nade kill top banana, but you were overly aggressive after you thought it was clear which got you killed by the third enemy who was there with a shotgun. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window flash banana, you were extremely uncomfortable in your positioning bottom middle once second middle was compromised I would recommend going to backup your teammate and regain map control because he ended up pushing banana alone and died without anyone to trade him. L</li>
                    <li>CT armour, nice attempt at catching the enemy jumping out apps unfortunately you peeks following that engagement were what got you killed as you paniced and tried to spray the USP like it was a glock which got you dinked and tagged by the enemy with the tec-9. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, good job getting 1 kill against SMGS, you did your job. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice position arch unfortunately committing to the spray is a dangerous play as it took you slightly too long to get the first kill and once you did the second enemy knew your exact position and this allow them to kill you but not before you did a good amount of damage. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, when playing with the famas I recommend close to medium ranges as it is by far the weakest of all the rifles in the game, you should play it like its an upgraded SMG and you will find a lot more success like this, unfortunately, you got overly aggressive and pushed down middle but that was okay since it was a 5v1. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice headshot position on A site looking into apps I really like this position as it is not commonly played and this allowed you to secure an easy kill but unfortunately after you made this really good play you spent too much time changing positions out in the open which got you traded by a second enemy in apps. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Molly dropped apps was too early and was wasted as it was finished by the time the enemies actually came, nice kill from belcony into apps but I will show you superior positions and how you should hold apps from pit, you started holding long when it was your job to hold apps and this got you punished. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice position pit but you played it dangerously and incorrectly sometimes, pit is by far one of the most powerful positions on A site and anytime you can fight and enemy from pit the fight is heavily in your favor. L</li>
                    <li>P250, nice kill from construction on B against the AK, and good attempt at getting the second kill but there wasn’t much more you could do as you were low and had no armour. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice banana flash, weird rotations from coffins back to CT after there seemed to be an exec, fortunately the enemies did not commit to B otherwise this would have been a bad mistake, unfortunate over flick on the enemy site which caused you to miss his head but your spray managed to bring it back to an almost kill, I would recommend lowering your sens so this types of flicks happen less. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, the constantly changing of positions left you out in unknown territory multiple times which was very dangerous and it eventually punished you as there were no teammates holding brackets or long which they eventually pushed. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice flashes top banana allowing your teammate to get a pick down banana, slight smoke mistake dropping it early, your positioning was dangerous but you had a very nice flick on the enemy arch which fortunately was below 40 hp. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, during this round you gave away your positional advantage which allowed the enemies to attack you from multiple sides good job getting 1 kill but if you would have stayed hidden longer you could have secured at least 2. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting position on A and I personally think its a very dangerous position as it is often preferred </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game? <br> Yes, T side was comfortable but I was not comfortable in the second half as my teammates started flaming me.</li>
                    <li>How did you crosshair placement feel? <br> I didn't really focus on that during this game so I can't say</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel? <br> First half was really good and confident but second half overall was quite slow</li>
                    <li>How did you positioning feel? <br> Felt like I usually put myself in advantageoous posiitions</li>
                    <li>How did you utility feel? <br> Utility felt alright but limited on T side due to teamamtes computer</li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> Nope.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you could immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Flash and use smokes more consistently</li>
                </ul>
